# **/*NEW/* Government Data Incident Reporting Platform**

Everyone in the community can play their part in strengthening and safeguarding government ICT (information and communications technology) systems, digital services, and data. Members of the public can now report incidents involving any unauthorised disclosure or compromise of government data on our government data incident reporting platform.

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the overall public sector data security regime.
